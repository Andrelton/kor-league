# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Owner.create(name: "Brad")
# Owner.create(name: "Dean")
# Owner.create(name: "Rik")
# Owner.create(name: "Eric")
# Owner.create(name: "Nick")
# Owner.create(name: "Jarred")
# Owner.create(name: "John K.")
# Owner.create(name: "Mark")
# Owner.create(name: "John Z.")
# Owner.create(name: "Matt")
# Owner.create(name: "Luke")
